Stepper Motor controller written in assembly.
You can open this project using MCU IDE or other. 
It is a fairly simple program:

It has 3 states. The first one is "wait", where the program waits for a button to be pressed. Then you can turn in a clockwise motion where the program will turn on the exits in the sequence 1-2-3-4. Lastly there is one state to turn on anti-clockwise movement where the program will turn on the sequency 4-3-2-1.
